# Functions

> Functions are part of the data type "object" and their role is to allow the creation of a block of code that can be invoked and executed whenever we want. It is useful for declaring a certain code once inside the function block and executing it whenever necessary.

> We can pass values along to the functions and these values will be used to produce a given output.
